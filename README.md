# Red Hawk

Web Application Scanner Framework based in Django.

Red Hawk is a framework, developed in Django, whose purpose is to perform penetration testing on current web applications. In a particular way, regarding web application security auditing, Red Hawk has used the OWASP 4.0 methodology.

OWASP (acronym for Open Web Application Security Project) is an open-source project dedicated to determining and combating the causes that make software insecure.

The OWASP Foundation is a non-profit organisation that supports and manages OWASP projects and infrastructure.

The OWASP community is made up of companies, educational organisations, and individuals from all over the world. Together they constitute a computer security community that works to create articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies that are released and can be used for free by any user or organisation. OWASP is a new type of entity in the computer security market. Being free from corporate pressure makes it easy for OWASP to provide unbiased, practical, and reusable information on computer application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although it does support the informed use of security technologies. OWASP recommends approaching the security of computer applications considering all its dimensions: people, processes, and technologies.

OWASP's most successful documents include the OWASP Guide and the widely adopted OWASP Top 10 self-assessment document. Commonly used OWASP tools include the WebGoat training environment, the WebScarab penetration testing tool, and security utilities for .NET environments. OWASP DotNet.

It has about 50 local chapters around the world and thousands of participants on the project's mailing lists. OWASP has organized the AppSec conference series to improve building the web application security community.

Red Hawk offers 3 different types of scans:

Discovery: allows you to discover the ports and services exposed on the target host.

CMS: allows the discovery of interesting findings, configuration flaws and vulnerabilities for which the CMS (Content Management System) is vulnerable.

All: allows for the performance of an exhaustive scan through which the tasks described in the two previous types of scanner are carried out, together with the discovery of web application vulnerabilities.
